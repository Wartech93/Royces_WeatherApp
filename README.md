## Installation

Open the link from my github io and you will be able to use it!

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Screenshot1](/assets/images/screenshot_1.png)
![Screenshot2](/assets/images/screenshot_2.png)
 

## Credits

I worked with a number of my classmates in order to construct this site. We were able to figure out many of the functions of it together. I was also able to do research on my own to get everything working!

I used Bootstrap for styling as well.

## Features
This site will give you the weather currently and the 5-day forecast for any city that you insert into the text box.
This site is capable of logging past city searches so you can go back and click your past searches to bring up the local weather for that location!


## Tests

I tested this site repeatedly in order to get everything functioning. It took MANY MANY attempts but I was finally able  to get it to a functioning state. There is more that I would like to add to it, however because I am short on time with another project looming this is it's state. For now... Have fun!
